#  VR Lab Simulation
The goal of the project is to make a VR-game based educational lab simulation that transports students into the heart of realistic lab simulations(Currently Osmosis simulation). This virtual learning environment will serve as a dynamic platform where students can actively engage with complex scientific concepts, conduct experiments, and hone practical skills, all within the immersive and risk-free confines of the virtual realm.
